# Quick webpack Configuration

```js
 mix.webpackConfig({} || cb);
```

While, of course, you're free to edit the provided `webpack.config.js` file, in certain settings, it's easier to modify or override the default settings directly from your `webpack.mix.js` file. This is particularly true for Laravel apps, where, by default, the `webpack.config.js` isn't available in the project root.

As an example, perhaps you want to add a custom array of modules that should be automatically loaded by webpack. You have two options in this scenario:

1. Edit your `webpack.config.js` file, as needed.
2. Call `mix.webpackConfig()` within your `webpack.mix.js` file, and pass your overrides. Mix will then perform a deep merge.

Below, as an example, we'll add a custom module path for Laravel Spark.

```js
mix.webpackConfig({
    resolve: {
        modules: [
            'node_modules',
            path.resolve(__dirname, 'vendor/laravel/spark/resources/assets/js')
        ]
    }
});
```

## Using a Callback Function

You can access webpack and all of its properties when passing a callback function.

```js
mix.webpackConfig(webpack => {
    return {
        plugins: [
            new webpack.ProvidePlugin({
                $: 'jquery',
                jQuery: 'jquery', 
                'window.jQuery': 'jquery',
            })
        ]
    };
});
```

## Replacing, Merging and Skipping Webpack Rules

You can hook into the default rules, replace, merge or skip them:

```js
// Skip rule
Mix.customizeRule.fonts = (rule, Config) => ({})
```

```js
// Replace rule
Mix.customizeRule.images = (rule, Config) => ({
    // completely replaces the original rule
    test: /\.png$/,
    loaders: [
      {
        loader: 'html-loader',
        options: {
          minimize: true
        }
      }
    ]
});
```

```js
// merge with own rules
Mix.customizeRule.images = (rule, Config) => {
    // only replace the test
    rule.test = /\.png$/;
    // add an exclude configuration
    rule.exclude = /node_modules\/quill\/assets\/icons\/(.*)\.svg$/;
    // and add a loader
    rule.loaders.push(myLoader);
    // the remaining original rule's configuration stays the same 
    return rule;
};
```

To inspect the rules used by laravel-mix, have a look at their sources in `src/rules`.

You can also hook into the preprocessor rules, dynamically generated by laravel mix.
To do so, use the preprocessor type name and suffix it with Preprocessor: 
e.g. `Mix.customizeRule.sassPreprocessor` â€“ but don't confuse this
with `Mix.customizeRule.sass`.
